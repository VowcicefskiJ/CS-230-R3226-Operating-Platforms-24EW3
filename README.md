Draw It or Lose It
Overview

"Draw It or Lose It" is a web-based drawing game that challenges teams to guess what is being drawn. Originally designed for Android, this project aims to extend its accessibility across various platforms, including iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web browsers, enhancing its reach and engagement.
Features

    Multi-Platform Support: Enjoy the game on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and web browsers.
    Multiplayer Experience: Compete with multiple teams and players in a fun and engaging environment.
    Unique Identifiers: Utilizes unique IDs for games, teams, and players to prevent conflicts.
    Optimized Resource Management: Employs a singleton pattern for efficient game instance management.

System Architecture

The game adopts a three-tier architecture to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience:

    Presentation Tier: A user-friendly web interface for interaction.
    Logic Tier: Server-side logic that enforces game rules and mechanics.
    Data Tier: Robust database management for storing game data and user progress.

Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive design.
    Backend: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
    Database: MongoDB for data storage


# CS 230 Course Reflection

## Project Overview

For this CS 230 course, I've wrapped up the software design document for a made-up client, The Gaming Room. They needed a design for a web-based version of their game, "Draw It or Lose It," which was previously Android-exclusive. They wanted the game to be accessible across different platforms and capable of handling multiple players and game instances smoothly.

## What I Did Well

Honestly, I think I did a solid job on the documentation part. I managed to detail the software requirements and the system architecture in a way that was both comprehensive and understandable. I'm particularly proud of how I broke down the user needs into implementable features for the development team.

## The Process

Working through the design document was super helpful in visualizing how the pieces of the application fit together. It made coding the software feel more guided because I had a clear blueprint to follow. Plus, it was a great exercise in thinking critically about how each component interacts with others.

## Area for Improvement

If I had to pick one part to revise, it would be the section on distributed systems and networks. I feel like I could have gone deeper into how the game's components communicate over the network. Improving this would make the document even more valuable, especially for the backend team dealing with server communication and data synchronization.

## User Needs Interpretation

Interpreting the user's needs was crucial. It wasn't just about listing features but understanding how those features would affect the player's experience. It's crucial because, at the end of the day, if the users aren't happy, the software won't be successful. I tried to keep the user's perspective in mind throughout the design process, ensuring the game was fun, responsive, and accessible.

## Designing Software

As for my approach to designing software, I leaned heavily on breaking down the project into smaller, manageable components. For future projects, I plan to continue using this strategy, coupled with more user feedback sessions early in the design phase. This way, I can ensure the software not only meets the technical requirements but also resonates with the users.
